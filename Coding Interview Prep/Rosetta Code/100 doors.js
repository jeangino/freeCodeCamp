 * There are 100 doors in a row that are all initially closed.
 * You make 100 passes by the doors.
 * The first time through, visit every door and 'toggle' the door (if the door is closed, open it; if it is open, close it).
 * The second time, only visit every 2nd door (i.e., door #2, #4, #6, ...) and toggle it.
 * The third time, visit every 3rd door (i.e., door #3, #6, #9, ...), etc., until you only visit the 100th door.
